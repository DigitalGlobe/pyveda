Accessing Data from Veda
==========================

Veda stores machine learning data collections. These can be generated from DigitalGlobe's satellite imagery, or can be imported from other sources. For example, Veda hosts copies of the XView dataset.

So how do you get that data out of Veda and into your models?

Veda's Data Storage
---------------------

Let's start with looking at how Veda stores data. 

.. Note:: The language used here is in flux - we use *collection* and *dataset* to mean the same thing. Similarly, *sample* and *datapoint* get interchanged.

Samples
**********

The basic unit of training data is called a sample. It consists of an image, and a label that describes the features in the image. Veda supports three types of labels:

- Classification
- Object Detection
- Segmentation

*Classification* labels indicate whether a class of features exists in the image. The value is a boolean, where a true value for a class means the class is present.

*Object Detection* labels describe where features are located, if they are in the image. The value is a bounding box of pixel values, so each label would indicate where in the image the class feature exists.

*Segmentation* labels are similar to Object Detection labels, but instead of a bounding box, the feature is described by a polygon object that can trace the outline of the feature.

Sample objects also store geospatial information if it's known. Any data generated by Veda will have spatial data, but it's also possible to import ungeoreferenced images.

See the :ref:`Label Formats` section for more information about how labels are used in pyveda.

Collections
******************

All of the samples are stored in groups called collections that keep things sorted and organized. A collection would group data around a theme or area. Collections have unique names to identify them. They also enforces consistency in the data. Some of the requirements of a collection are:

- All images must be the same size in pixels
- All images must have the same number of bands
- All images must share the same data type
- All labels must be the same type - classification, object detection, or segmentation.

Collections also track their contents. A collection knows all of the classes represented in the samples' labels. It also tracks the spatial bounds of all the samples.

Finding Collections with pyveda
---------------------------------

The first step to working with data stored in Veda is to find a collection to work with. If you're following a tutorial or a notebook the name of the collection should be given. You can use the name to access the collection. This is covered in the section `Accessing Collections`_.

If you'd like to find a collection to investigate, pyveda has the `search` method (see :meth:`pyveda.main.search`). Let's start with the simplest example:

.. code-block:: python

    import pyveda as pv
    pv.search()

    [VedaCollectionProxy of Las Vegas Buildings (SpaceNet2) (84810fa8-87e2-4f22-9386-4406b4c3add0), VedaCollectionProxy of X-View Data Complete (b030111a-f13f-40d4-90fb-3dcb826069d8)]

The `search` method searches Veda for collections and can take key words and filters. It returns a list of VedaCollectionProxy objects, which is a pyveda object that acts as an entry point to working with the collection. We can take a closer look at the collections returned by the search:

.. code-block:: python

    results = pv.search()
    print(results[0])

    X-View Data Complete (b030111a-f13f-40d4-90fb-3dcb826069d8)
        - Bounds: [-99.09676905613048, -34.9111829655798, 151.23452243531614, 53.92520692619612]
        - Count: 173075 samples, 87% cached
        - Chips: 256x256, 3 bands int8
        - Labels: object detection type, 113 classes

These collection objects have an informative ``__str__`` method that prints collection details in a readable format. You can use the ``repr`` function to print the shorter representation of just the name and ID.

To search for terms, pass them to the search function:

.. code-block:: python

    pv.search('building')

    [VedaCollectionProxy of Las Vegas Buildings (SpaceNet2) (84810fa8-87e2-4f22-9386-4406b4c3add0)]

Filters can also be added. The queries use ElasticSearch syntax:

.. code-block:: python

    pv.search('building', )


Accessing Collections
------------------------

If you have a run a search, you can work directly on the VedaCollectionProxies returned by the search.

.. code-block:: python

    results = pv.search('building)
    collection = results[0] # get the first search result
    # do something with the collection

If you have a name or ID of a collection, you can access it with these methods:

.. code-block:: python

    collection = pv.from_name('X-View Data Complete')

    collection = pv.from_id('b030111a-f13f-40d4-90fb-3dcb826069d8')


Working with the Samples
------------------------

Once you have a collection in the form of a VedaCollectionProxy, you can treat it like a list of datapoints. It supports indexing and slicing:

.. code-block:: python

    sample = collection[0] # the first sample
    print(sample)

    {'mltype': 'segmentation', 'cached': 'true', 'dataset_id': '84810fa8-87e2-4f22-9386-4406b4c3add0', 'bounds': [-115.2847026, 36.1669076998, -115.2829476, 36.1686626998], 'dtype': 'uint8', 'tile_coords': [12......

If you look representation of the sample object (cut short here), you'll see it's metadata and label data. We can also look at the some of the sample's specific properties:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> rr.classes
    ['buildings']

    >>> rr.label
    {'buildings': [{'type': 'Polygon'..........

    >>> rr.image
    [image]

The sample object also has some basic CRUD methods:

.. code-block:: python

    # a modified label
    label = {buildings: [.......
    # update the sample with the new label
    sample.update(label)

    #delete a sample
    sample.delete()

Using Samples with Models
-------------------------

In most machine learning examples, you have to download all of the sample image files and labels to a local directory. Then you have to split up your data into training and testing groups, and probably also convert the data into array formats that can be read as inputs. 

We saw in the previous section how to look at the samples in the collection. So what's the best way to get that sample data to your model? You could certainly loop through all the samples and save their images and labels to files.

Pyveda does provide a way to download the image and label files - see the :ref:`Releases` section. Pyveda makes it easy to get the data in this format - with a single command you get a link to download the compressed file. But pyveda also provides better ways to access the data locally.

To fetch a local cache of the data, use the `store` method. This downloads the sample data to a local file called a VedaBase. Instead of directories of images, Vedabases are single files that hold optimized sample data. All of the sample points have been converted to the correct array formats: the images are numpy arrays, and the labels are one-hot encoded. The `store` method takes a collections name or ID, and a path to store the file to. It then uses a multithreaded downloader to fetch all the data. You will need to wait for this step to complete before proceeding.

.. code-block:: python

    pv.store('./lasvegas.vdb', dataset_name='Las Vegas Buildings (SpaceNet2)')

You can open a saved VedaBase with the ``open`` function. We recommend using a Vedabase with a context manager:

.. code-block:: python

    with pv.open(filename='./lasvegas.vdb') as data:
        # do something with the data

The ``store`` method also works as a context manager, but you still will have to wait for the data to download locally.


Collection Groups
--------------------

VedaBases internally store separate training, validation, and testing groups, so you don't have to divide the data. The ratio of sample is each group is set by the `partition` property of the collection.

Each group is an accessor on the collection. You can access samples in the group just like a list, through iteration or indexing. The value returned is an ``(image, label)`` tuple. As mentioned above, the image and label have been coverted to the appropriate arrays already.

.. code-block:: python

    data.train[0] # the first sample in the training group

    for image, label in data.test:
        # do something with each image and label in the testing group

The collection also lets you access the images and labels separately:

.. code-block:: python

    for label in data.test.labels:
        # do something with just each label in the testing group

This means that a typical training example might look like:

.. code-block:: python

    from SuperMLDetector import MegaModel

    megamodel = MegaModel()

    with pv.open(filename='./lasvegas.vdb') as data:
        megamodel.train(data.train)
        megamodel.score(data.test)
    

Batching and Transforming Data
-------------------------------

Pyveda includes tools for batching and transforming data. 

.. code-block:: python

    gen = vb.train.batch_generator(6, shuffle = True, rescale = True)
    
    for x, y in gen:
        print(x)


Streaming Remote Data
--------------------------

.. Warning:: This direct access will probably be removed so that data can be accessed on demand while being locally cached. Because the samples aren't cached, they are loaded every time they are accessed. Using this over many epochs will be slower than saving a local file.

For preliminary testing, or algorithms that only need to work with the datapoints once, it's possible to open the collection directly from Veda, and the samples are loaded on demand. This uses the same `open` function as loading a local file, and data access is performed the same.


.. code-block:: python

    with pv.open(dataset_name='Las Vegas Buildings (SpaceNet2)') as data:
        # do something with the data or

    with pv.open(dataset_id='84810fa8-87e2-4f22-9386-4406b4c3add0') as data:
        # do something with the data

Creating Releases
--------------------

A Veda Release is a compressed archive of the images and labels stored as individual files. You can see more about the Release format and structure in the :ref:`Releases` section. To generate a release, run:

.. code-block:: python

     collection.release()
