# PyVeda

This is the python API for [veda](https://github.com/DigitalGlobe/veda), DigitalGlobe's in development machine learning and computer vision toolchain. While veda is primarily a backend server that stores training data, models and inference results for satellite imagery, pyveda is currently its face. The tools being developed here are meant to provide users with access to existing training data/models, help in the creation of new data and models, and provide a platform interacting with all facets of veda. 

## Currently under heavy development so expect a few changes...

## Installation 

```
pip install pyveda
```
